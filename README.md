# file-guard

Per-process access control for credential files. *Little Snitch, but for file reads.*

Any process running as you can read `~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.config/gcloud/...`,
`~/.claude/.credentials.json`, your SSH keys — and exfiltrate them. File
permissions don't help: the malicious code **runs as you**. This is the
supply-chain secret-theft problem: one poisoned dependency reads every secret on
disk.

A password manager (1Password, `pass`, …) solves this for tools that accept
injected env vars (`op run`, `.envrc` + `op read`). But many tools **write
plaintext credentials to disk and read them back themselves** — `gcloud`, `aws`,
`docker login`, `kubectl`, `gh`, the Claude Code CLI. You can't keep those only
in a vault. file-guard sits in front of those on-disk files and only lets
processes **you've authorized** read *and write* them; everything else is denied
(or prompted).

## How it works

For each watched file, file-guard moves the real contents into a backing store
and serves the original path through an interception layer. On every `open()` it
resolves the **calling process** and consults your policy, in the **direction**
of the access (read vs write):

| Policy state            | Action                                   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Allowed (rule)          | serve / accept the real contents         |
| Denied (rule)           | return `EACCES`                          |
| Allowed (this session)  | serve / accept the real contents         |
| Unknown                 | prompt you (or fall back to `default_action`) |

A read-write FUSE file is mounted at the original path; the caller PID comes from
the FUSE request and is resolved via `/proc/<pid>/exe`. Reads serve the stored
contents; authorized writes are buffered and persisted back to the store on
close. Consuming tools need no reconfiguration: the path they read/write is
unchanged.

(A macOS Endpoint Security backend exists in-tree but is not built — see
[macOS](#macos).)

### Identity: pinned by content hash

A transient grant ("allow once / this session") is bound to the **exact process
instance** (pid + start time), so a recycled PID can't inherit it. A permanent
"allow always" rule **pins the binary's sha256** (and, on macOS, its code
signature); for an interpreter it also pins the **entry script's path and
content hash**, so "python running gcloud" doesn't bless other scripts and an
in-place edit of the script re-prompts. If a pinned binary or script later
changes — a package upgrade, or malware swapped in its place — the pin no longer
matches and file-guard **re-prompts** rather than silently honoring the old
grant. (A mismatch re-prompts; it is not a hard deny, so a legitimate rebuild
just re-authorizes.)

### Prompts: the session agent

The root daemon has no terminal or display, so it doesn't draw prompts itself —
it asks a small **session agent** (`file-guard agent`) running as you, over a
unix socket. The agent renders the prompt (GUI via `zenity`/`kdialog`, a terminal
fallback, or a desktop notification) and returns your choice. If the agent is
unreachable, the daemon applies `default_action` (deny by default) — it never
blocks. See [the agent socket note](#security-model--limitations) for why the
socket is root-anchored.

## Install

### Debian / Ubuntu

Grab the `.deb` from a [release](https://github.com/gantryops/file-guard/releases):

```sh
sudo apt install ./file-guard_*_amd64.deb
```

It installs the binary, a root `file-guard.service`, and a per-user
`file-guard-agent.service`, and pulls in `fuse3`. Nothing is enabled until you
configure it — see [2b](#2b-privileged-daemon-the-secure-deployment) and
[`packaging/README.md`](packaging/README.md).

### Nix

```sh
# Try it without installing
nix run github:gantryops/file-guard -- --help

# Dev shell (cargo, rustc, clippy, rustfmt, fuse3 wired for pkg-config)
nix develop
cargo build

# Build the binary
nix build github:gantryops/file-guard
./result/bin/file-guard --help
```

### From source

Any Linux with `pkg-config` and `libfuse3` (Debian/Ubuntu: `fuse3`,
`libfuse3-dev`) plus a Rust toolchain, then `cargo build --release`.

## Quick start

### 1. Write a config

Start from [`config.example.toml`](config.example.toml), or compose per-tool
blocks from [`configs/`](configs/):

```sh
{ cat configs/_settings.toml configs/aws.toml configs/gcloud.toml configs/claude.toml; } \
  | sudo tee /etc/file-guard/config.toml
```

### 2a. Development (your own user — NOT secure, see limitations)

```sh
FILE_GUARD_CONFIG=~/.config/file-guard/config.toml file-guard start
```

Runs in the foreground; unknown accesses prompt you in the terminal. Useful to
see what touches your secrets, but the backing store is readable by your own user
(so same-uid malware can bypass it). For real protection use 2b.

### 2b. Privileged daemon (the secure deployment)

Run the daemon as **root** so the backing store at `/var/lib/file-guard` is
root-owned and unreadable by the user the malware runs as. **Both the Debian
package and the NixOS module do this** — that root-owned store is the protection
that matters. They differ only in how the prompt agent's socket is created (see
[the agent-socket note](#security-model--limitations)): NixOS roots the socket by
default; the `.deb` ships a convenient per-user socket but can be hardened the
same way.

**Debian / Ubuntu.** After installing the `.deb`:

```sh
echo 'FILE_GUARD_USER=alice' | sudo tee -a /etc/default/file-guard   # whose ~ is guarded
sudoedit /etc/file-guard/config.toml                                 # add [[watch]] blocks
systemctl --user enable --now file-guard-agent.service               # run as alice
sudo systemctl enable --now file-guard.service
```

**NixOS.** Add the flake and enable the module:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs.file-guard.url = "github:gantryops/file-guard";
  # …
}

# configuration.nix
{
  imports = [ inputs.file-guard.nixosModules.default ];
  services.file-guard = {
    enable = true;
    user = "alice";                              # whose ~ is guarded
    configFile = "/etc/file-guard/config.toml";  # paths use ~ → alice's home
  };
}
```

The module sets `programs.fuse.userAllowOther = true` so your tools can reach the
root-owned mounts, and wires a **socket-activated prompt agent** that runs as
`user`. For GUI prompts, point the agent at that user's session and switch the
method:

```nix
services.file-guard = {
  enable = true;
  user = "alice";
  configFile = "/etc/file-guard/config.toml";
  promptMethod = "gui";                       # default: "notification"
  agentEnvironment = {                        # so dialogs reach alice's display
    DISPLAY = ":0";
    XAUTHORITY = "/home/alice/.Xauthority";
    DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS = "unix:path=/run/user/1000/bus";
  };
};
```

The agent's socket is created by **root** (systemd socket activation) in a
root-owned directory, so a same-uid attacker can neither hijack the socket name
nor connect to it. With `promptMethod = "notification"` (the default) prompts are
informational only and unknown accesses deny on timeout — define explicit
`[[rule]]`s for that mode.

To try the GUI prompt path by hand (dev), run the agent in your graphical session
and the daemon alongside it (both as the same user resolve the same socket):

```sh
file-guard agent --method gui &                 # renders prompts in your session
FILE_GUARD_CONFIG=~/.config/file-guard/config.toml file-guard start
```

## Configuration

A single TOML file (no `include` mechanism yet). See
[`config.example.toml`](config.example.toml) for the full annotated reference and
[`configs/`](configs/) for drop-in per-tool blocks (aws, gcloud, claude, ssh,
docker, kubernetes, github, npm).

Rules created via "Allow always" / "Deny always" prompts are appended to the
config automatically.

## CLI

```
file-guard start [-d]                  # run the daemon (foreground; -d is a no-op)
file-guard agent [--method M] [--socket P]   # run the session prompt agent
file-guard stop                        # SIGTERM the running daemon (unmounts cleanly)
file-guard status                      # daemon state, mount status, recent access
file-guard log [-n N] [-f]             # print/follow the audit log (needs a file
                                       #   log_destination; else use journalctl)
file-guard rules                       # list rules (with indices)
file-guard rules add --file F --binary B --action allow|deny [--access read|write|any] [--no-pin]
file-guard rules remove <index>        # remove the rule at INDEX (preserves comments)
file-guard store <f>                   # move a file into the backing store
file-guard restore <f>                 # restore a file from the backing store
```

The audit log is NDJSON (one object per access) when `log_destination` is a file
path, so it's both human-readable via `file-guard log` and machine-queryable
(e.g. `jq` over the file).

## Security model & limitations

**Threat model:** non-root malware running as *you* (a poisoned dependency),
trying to read or write credential files. **Not** in scope: a root attacker (root
bypasses FUSE and can read anything), a process with `ptrace` over your session
(it can drive the agent or any of your processes), or network exfiltration.

Known limitations — read before relying on this:

- **Run it privileged, or it does nothing on Linux.** The backing store must be
  owned by a *different* uid than the guarded user; otherwise the same malware
  just reads the store directly. Both the Debian package and the NixOS module run
  the daemon as root for this reason. Running as your own user is
  development-only.
- **The prompt agent must be root-anchored to be fully trustworthy.** If same-uid
  malware can occupy the agent's socket, it can auto-approve its own prompts. The
  NixOS module prevents this by having **root** create the socket (systemd socket
  activation) in a root-owned directory. The Debian package's default per-user
  agent socket (in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`) is **not** hardened against a *targeted*
  same-uid attacker racing that socket — it is still defense-in-depth against
  opportunistic malware, and can be hardened to the root-anchored topology (see
  [`packaging/README.md`](packaging/README.md)). The manual/dev path
  (`file-guard agent` self-binding) carries the same caveat.
- **Linux only.** The macOS Endpoint Security path is not built — see
  [macOS](#macos).
- **Identity = binary hash (+ script path & content hash for interpreters); a
  trusted tool's own deps are still inside the boundary.** A rule pins the
  caller's binary sha256, and for interpreters (python/node/…) also the **script
  path** from argv and the **script's content hash** — so "python running gcloud"
  doesn't authorize "python running something else", and an in-place edit of the
  script re-prompts. Two caveats remain: the script *path* comes from argv, which
  a *deliberate* impersonator can forge (it's defense-in-depth, strongest against
  opportunistic disk-scanning malware, not a hard boundary); and nothing can stop
  a compromised dependency *inside* the legitimate tool from reading the secret
  that tool is authorized to use. Strongest for compiled tools, where the binary
  *is* the identity.
- **Nix/home-manager:** the resolved path is a `/nix/store/<hash>` path that
  changes on every package update. Hash-pinned rules **re-prompt** after an
  upgrade (by design) — just re-confirm. Credential files that are **symlinks**
  (e.g. `~/.npmrc` into the read-only Nix store) are now **refused** rather than
  clobbered; point the watch at the real file.
- **GUI needs a session.** Under systemd, GUI prompts only appear if the agent is
  given the user's display env (`agentEnvironment`); otherwise it falls back to
  notification/terminal and unknown accesses deny on timeout.
- **Writes are last-writer-wins.** Concurrent write handles to the same file
  don't merge; the last one to close persists its buffer. Fine for the
  single-writer credential-file case.

## Development

```sh
nix develop
cargo build
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
cargo test
```

CI runs the above on Linux for every push/PR.

## macOS

A macOS Endpoint Security backend exists in the tree (`src/es.rs`,
`src/process/macos.rs`) but is not built: it is excluded from the flake/CI and is
not wired to the current policy/agent. Finishing it needs the `es_message_t`
layout fix and the `start_time` offset fix, and — to run at all — an Endpoint
Security entitlement from Apple plus a signed, notarized binary running as root.
The policy, rules, identity pinning, and prompt agent are already
cross-platform, so the macOS work is wiring up enforcement, not a rewrite.
